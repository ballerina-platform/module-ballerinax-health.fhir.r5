# FHIR ExplanationOfBenefit resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + benefitPeriod - The term of the benefits documented in this response.
# + insurance - Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and services specified on the claim.
# + claimResponse - The business identifier for the instance of the adjudication response: claim, predetermination or preauthorization response.
# + traceNumber - Trace number for tracking purposes. May be defined at the jurisdiction level or between trading partners.
# + use - A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: Claim - A request to an Insurer to adjudicate the supplied charges for health care goods and services under the identified policy and to pay the determined Benefit amount, if any; Preauthorization - A request to an Insurer to adjudicate the supplied proposed future charges for health care goods and services under the identified policy and to approve the services and provide the expected benefit amounts and potentially to reserve funds to pay the benefits when Claims for the indicated services are later submitted; or, Pre-determination - A request to an Insurer to adjudicate the supplied 'what if' charges for health care goods and services under the identified policy and report back what the Benefit payable would be had the services actually been provided.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + preAuthRef - Reference from the Insurer which is used in later communications which refers to this adjudication.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + diagnosisRelatedGroup - A package billing code or bundle code used to group products and services to a particular health condition (such as heart attack) which is based on a predetermined grouping code system.
# + 'type - The category of claim, e.g. oral, pharmacy, vision, institutional, professional.

# + enterer - Individual who created the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.
# + payment - Payment details for the adjudication of the claim.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + careTeam - The members of the team who provided the products and services.
# + identifier - A unique identifier assigned to this explanation of benefit.
# + item - A claim line. Either a simple (a product or service) or a 'group' of details which can also be a simple items or groups of sub-details.

# + preAuthRefPeriod - The timeframe during which the supplied preauthorization reference may be quoted on claims to obtain the adjudication as provided.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + billablePeriod - The period for which charges are being submitted.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + subType - A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
# + status - The status of the resource instance.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + benefitBalance - Balance by Benefit Category.
# + accident - Details of a accident which resulted in injuries which required the products and services listed in the claim.
# + addItem - The first-tier service adjudications for payor added product or service lines.
# + total - Categorized monetary totals for the adjudication.

# + disposition - A human readable description of the status of the adjudication.
# + referral - The referral information received by the claim author, it is not to be used when the author generates a referral for a patient. A copy of that referral may be provided as supporting information. Some insurers require proof of referral to pay for services or to pay specialist rates for services.

To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + patientPaid - The amount paid by the patient, in total at the claim claim level or specifically for the item and detail level, to the provider for goods and services.
# + quantity - The number of repetitions of a service or product.
# + productOrServiceEnd - This contains the end of a range of product, service, drug or other billing codes for the item. This element is not used when the .productOrService is a group code. This value may only be present when a .productOfService code has been provided to convey the start of the range. Typically this value may be used only with preauthorizations and not with claims.
# + traceNumber - Trace number for tracking purposes. May be defined at the jurisdiction level or between trading partners.
# + programCode - Identifies the program under which this may be recovered.
# + modifier - Item typification or modifiers codes to convey additional context for the product or service.

# + unitPrice - If the item is not a group then this is the fee for the product or service, otherwise this is the total of the fees for the details of the group.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + patientPaid - The amount paid by the patient, in total at the claim claim level or specifically for the item and detail level, to the provider for goods and services.
# + quantity - The number of repetitions of a service or product.
# + productOrServiceEnd - This contains the end of a range of product, service, drug or other billing codes for the item. This element is not used when the .productOrService is a group code. This value may only be present when a .productOfService code has been provided to convey the start of the range. Typically this value may be used only with preauthorizations and not with claims.
# + traceNumber - Trace number for tracking purposes. May be defined at the jurisdiction level or between trading partners.
# + modifier - Item typification or modifiers codes to convey additional context for the product or service.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + subDetail - The third-tier service adjudications for payor added services.
# + tax - The total of taxes applicable for this product or service.
# + productOrService - When the value is a group code then this item collects a set of related item details, otherwise this contains the product, service, drug or other billing code for the item. This element may be the start of a range of .productOrService codes used in conjunction with .productOrServiceEnd or it may be a solo element where .productOrServiceEnd is not used.
# + noteNumber - The numbers associated with notes below which apply to the adjudication of this item.
# + revenue - The type of revenue or cost center providing the product and/or service.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + factor - A real number that represents a multiplier used in determining the overall value of services delivered and/or goods received. The concept of a Factor allows for a discount or surcharge multiplier to be applied to a monetary amount.
# + net - The total amount claimed for the group (if a grouper) or the addItem.detail. Net = unit price * quantity * factor.

# FHIR ExplanationOfBenefitInsurance datatype record.
#
# + coverage - Reference to the insurance card level information contained in the Coverage resource. The coverage issuing insurer will use these details to locate the patient's actual coverage within the insurer's information system.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + focal - A flag to indicate that this Coverage is to be used for adjudication of this claim when set to true.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + preAuthRef - Reference numbers previously provided by the insurer to the provider to be quoted on subsequent claims containing services or products related to the prior authorization.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
