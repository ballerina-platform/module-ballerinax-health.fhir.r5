# FHIR Device resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Descriptive information, usage information or implantation information that is not captured in an existing element.
# + parent - The higher level or encompassing device that this device is a logical part of.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + biologicalSourceEvent - An identifier that supports traceability to the event during which material in this product from one or more biological entities was obtained or pooled.
# + displayName - The name used to display by default when the device is referenced. Based on intent of use by the resource creator, this may reflect one of the names in Device.name, or may be another simple name.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'type - The kind or type of device. A device instance may have more than one type - in which case those are the types that apply to the specific instance of the device.
# + cycle - The series of occurrences that repeats during the operation of the device.
# + manufacturer - A name of the manufacturer or entity legally responsible for the device.
# + duration - A measurement of time during the device's operation (e.g., days, hours, mins, etc.).
# + mode - The designated condition for performing a task with the device.
# + endpoint - Technical endpoints providing access to services provided by the device defined at this resource.
# + safety - Provides additional safety characteristics about a medical device. For example devices containing latex.
# + contact - Contact details for an organization or a particular human that is responsible for the device.
# + property - Static or essentially fixed characteristics or features of the device (e.g., time or timing attributes, resolution, accuracy, intended use or instructions for use, and physical attributes) that are not otherwise captured in more specific attributes.
# + manufactureDate - The date and time when the device was manufactured.
# + definition - The reference to the definition for the device.
# + availabilityStatus - The availability of the device.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + expirationDate - The date and time beyond which this device is no longer valid or should not be used (if applicable).
# + owner - An organization that is responsible for the provision and ongoing maintenance of the device.
# + identifier - Unique instance identifiers assigned to a device by manufacturers other organizations or owners.
# + serialNumber - The serial number assigned by the organization when the device was manufactured.
# + lotNumber - Lot number assigned by the manufacturer.
# + 'version - The actual design of the device or software version running on the device.
# + url - A network address on which the device may be contacted directly.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.
# + udiCarrier - Unique device identifier (UDI) assigned to device label or package. Note that the Device may include multiple udiCarriers as it either may include just the udiCarrier for the jurisdiction it is sold, or for multiple jurisdictions it could have been sold.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + name - This represents the manufacturer's name of the device as provided by the device, from a UDI label, or by a person describing the Device. This typically would be used when a person provides the name(s) or when the device represents one of the names available from DeviceDefinition.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + location - The place where the device can be found.
# + modelNumber - The manufacturer's model number for the device.
# + partNumber - The part number or catalog number of the device.
# + conformsTo - Identifies the standards, specifications, or formal guidances for the capabilities supported by the device. The device may be certified as conformant to these specifications e.g., communication, performance, process, measurement, or specialization standards.
# + category - Devices may be associated with one or more categories.
# + gateway - The linked device acting as a communication controller, data collector, translator, or concentrator for the current device (e.g., mobile phone application that relays a blood pressure device's data).
# + status - The Device record status. This is not the status of the device like availability.
