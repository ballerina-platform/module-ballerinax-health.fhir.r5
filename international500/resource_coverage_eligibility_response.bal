# FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + insurance - Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and services.
# + request - Reference to the original request resource.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + purpose - Code to specify whether requesting: prior authorization requirements for some service categories or billing codes; benefits for coverages specified or discovered; discovery and return of coverages for the patient; and/or validation that the specified coverage is in-force at the date/period specified or 'now' if not specified.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + preAuthRef - A reference from the Insurer to which these services pertain to be used on further communication and as proof that the request occurred.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'error - Errors encountered during the processing of the request.
# + servicedPeriod - The date or dates when the enclosed suite of services were performed or completed.
# + insurer - The Insurer who issued the coverage in question and is the author of the response.
# + patient - The party who is the beneficiary of the supplied coverage and for whom eligibility is sought.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + event - Information code for an event with a corresponding date or period.
# + outcome - The outcome of the request processing.
# + identifier - A unique identifier assigned to this coverage eligiblity request.
# + created - The date this resource was created.
# + requestor - The provider which is responsible for the request.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.
# + disposition - A human readable description of the status of the adjudication.
# + form - A code for the form to be used for printing the content.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + servicedDate - The date or dates when the enclosed suite of services were performed or completed.
# + status - The status of the resource instance.
